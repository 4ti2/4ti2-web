<b>Changes in version 1.3.2</b><p>

This release fixes minor bugs and portability problems.  It is a source-only
release, using a new build system (GNU Autotools).  It has been tested
on GNU/Linux (i386 and AMD64 architectures), Windows (with Cygwin),
Solaris (SPARC), and Mac OS X. 
<ul>
<li> Fixed bug in `markov' for computing with inhomogeneous lattice ideals for unsaturated lattices.
<li> Fixed bug in `minimize' for determining whether a cost function is bounded or not.
</ul>
<p>

<b>New functionality in version 1.3.1</b><p>

There are quite some changes and new functions with this version (compared to version 1.2).<p>

<ul>
<li> 'groebner' and 'markov' are again heavily improved.
<li> 'groebner' and 'markov' allow non-homogeneous lattice ideals.
<li> 'groebner' and 'markov' allow truncation.
<li> There is a new function 'walk' performing a Gr&ouml;bner walk.
<li> There are new functions 'qsolve' and 'zsolve' for solving linear 
     systems over the reals or the integers, respectively.
<li> There are new functions 'rays' and 'circuits' to compute extreme rays 
     and circuits.
<li> The functions 'circuits' and 'graver' allow to fix certain orthants.
<li> One may compute with projections by specifying variables to be ignored.
<li> There is a new function 'minimize' to solve integer linear programs.
</ul>
