<b>New functionality in version 1.3.1</b><p>

<ul>
<li> 'groebner' and 'markov' are again heavily improved.
<li> 'groebner' and 'markov' allow non-homogeneous lattice ideals.
<li> 'groebner' and 'markov' allow truncation.
<li> There is a new function 'walk' performing a Gr&ouml;bner walk.
<li> There are new functions 'qsolve' and 'zsolve' for solving linear 
     systems over the reals or the integers, respectively.
<li> There are new functions 'rays' and 'circuits' to compute extreme rays 
     and circuits.
<li> The functions 'circuits' and 'graver' allow to fix certain orthants.
<li> One may compute with projections by specifying variables to be ignored.
<li> There is a new function 'minimize' to solve integer linear programs.
</ul>
