Here we list a few things that we plan to include in the future. We
are very interested in <b>your suggestions</b> of useful improvements or
additions to the code.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Use long long int and gmp for long integer arithmetics also in 'zsolve'.
  <li> sparse implementation of 'groebner' and 'markov'
  <li> binomial ideals (generated by a*x^b-x^c, no cancellation
       allowed)
  <li> computation of Hilbert bases from cone generators
  <li> weighted poincare series
  <li> computations on monomial ideals such as primary decomposition
</ul>
