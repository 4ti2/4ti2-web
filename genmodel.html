usage: genmodel [--options] FILENAME

Computes the problem matrix corresponding to graphical statistical models
given by a simplicial complex and levels on the nodes.

Options:
 -q, --quiet	No output is written to the screen

Input file:
FILENAME.mod    Simplicial complex and levels on the nodes

Output file:
FILENAME.mat    Matrix file

Example: Consider the problem of 3x3x3 tables with 2-marginals. These
are given by K_3 as the simplicial complex on 3 nodes and with levels
of 3 on each node.  In '333.mod' write:
3
3 3 3
3
2 1 2
2 2 3
2 3 1
Calling 'genmodel 333' produces the following file '333.mat':
